# Project-4.-Data-Engineering

## Goal
To determine the ideal locations for e-scooters in major cities across Germany.

## Overview 
GANS is a new e-scooter rental company aiming to operate in cities across Germany. Leveraging web scraping, API data collection, MySQL databases, and AWS Lambda automation, GANS hopes to optimize their fleet deployment strategy.

### Task: 
* Use webscraping for information about cities incl.: their size, population, attractiveness to tourists
* Use API's to get flight and weather information - as e-scooters are popular among tourists, especially budget travellers
* Use MySQL database to connect all insights in a logical way
* Use Jupyter notebooks to build a local pipeline
* Use AWS Lambda automation to deploy in the Cloud
