# Project-4.-Data-Engineering

## Goal
To determine the ideal locations for e-scooters in major cities across Germany.

## Overview 
GANS is a new e-scooter rental company aiming to operate in cities across Germany. Leveraging web scraping, API data collection, MySQL databases, and AWS Lambda automation, GANS hopes to optimize their fleet deployment strategy.

### Task: 
* Use webscraping for information about cities incl.: their size, population, attractiveness to tourists
* Use API's to get flight and weather information - as e-scooters are popular among tourists, especially budget travellers
* Use MySQL database to connect all insights in a logical way
* Use Jupyter notebooks to build a local pipeline
* Use AWS Lambda automation to deploy in the Cloud

## Deliverables
Overview article on **Medium** found [here](https://medium.com/@ubp0528/what-goes-into-e-scooter-deployment-a-data-engineering-story-390a2dbcb077) that succintly summarizes the findings and the process.
**Python code** with the clean notebooks are found [here](), and the code for creating a database in **SQL** is found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KwHx9qjUA2MKKZsPvTDS6NrKoIoTL-C8/view?usp=drive_link). 

## Skills & Tools
1. Webscraping
2. API's 
3. MySQL
4. Jupyter Notebooks
5. AWS Lambda

## Furher Considerations (limited due to the time allocated for the project)
1. Consideration of budget airlines, define and select budget airlines
2. Research cities that are not major cities ex.: Berlin, but get a lot of tourists for some specific attraction
3. Take into consideration seasonality or some special event ex.: Octoberfest or Rock Im Ring.
4. Incentivize e-scooter use in bad weather
5. Incentivize the parking of e-scooters in areas where they will be more likely to be rented. Ex.: More likely to rent at the bottom of a hill to go up than the other way around.
